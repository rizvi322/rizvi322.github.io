I started working as part of **Widget framework (WF)** team. **WF** is an add-on product for the Escenic Content Engine (ECE). Some of the significant features of WF that I have worked on are:

- **Build system** of the product. It involves Jenkins build and deployment scripts, processing resources, merging several configuration layers creating final distribution, creating RCs etc.
- **Core of the framework**. Worked on handling concurrent requests, request filter chain, **lazy loading**, **image processing**, image preloading, caching, context resolving, **REST** webservices etc.
- **Datasource**: Fetching different types of content from different sources like **Solr**, analysis engine, our CMS. It is extendable and can be used to fetch data from custom sources.
- **Media widget**: Processing video and audio. We use Amazon Elastic Transcoder for media transcoding and Amazon S3 storage for storing.
- **Teaser widget**: A highly customizable widget that simplifies the presentation of the framework in the website.

Apart from WF, I have also:

- Worked on database, server logs and configurations, tomcat configurations, performance improvement of datasource, the entire distributed Escenic system while debugging and handling customer issues.
- Worked on our main CMS known as the **Escenic Content Engine**, **Poll plugin**, **Analysis engine**. Worked on architecture and development of our content versioning system (**Snapshot plugin**) from scratch.
- Worked on our newest product **CUE**. It is fully web-based and uses **Escenic Content Engine** as the backend. I mainly worked on the new **decoupled presentation framework** known as **CUE Front**. It is highly scalable (we have used **Docker**), Technology independent (**REST** based), Easily Upgradeable.
